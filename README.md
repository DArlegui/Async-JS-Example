## Example of Asynchronous Coding using Promises in JavaScript. 

- Here we are simulating an asynchronous operation with a setTimeout inside the makeDogPromise function. Asynchronous operations are common in JavaScript, especially when dealing with tasks like network requests, file I/O, or waiting for user interactions.

- We use Promises to handle the asynchronous operation. Promises are a clean and effective way to work with asynchronous code. They allow you to handle success (using .then()) and errors (using .catch()) in a structured manner.

- Here we handle the two possible outcomes of the Promise: resolving with 'Yay we got a dog!' and rejecting with ':( No dog'. This demonstrates how Promises can handle both successful and unsuccessful outcomes of asynchronous operations.

### Conclusion

Overall, this code serves as a simple and clear example of how to work with asynchronous operations using Promises, which is a fundamental concept in modern JavaScript programming.
