<!-- 
  This code showcases callback hell, a situation where nested callback functions become challenging to manage and read. In this example, a button element (`btn`) is repeatedly moved to the right by 300 pixels with a 1000ms delay.

- Each success callback triggers the next `moveX` call, creating deeply nested code.
- If the button reaches the screen boundary, a failure callback displays "CANNOT MOVE FURTHER!".
- The final success callback displays "YOU HAVE A WIDE SCREEN!".

Callback hell arises due to the pyramid-shaped structure of nested callbacks, making the code hard to maintain and understand. It's a prime example of the need for cleaner async code structures like Promises or async/await to avoid such complexities.
